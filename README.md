## Why Make this project
This project is just to reassure my understanding of how HTML and CSS work. There are still some things that I need to work on which include, class naming and determining whether I should use flex or grid in certain situations. But hey!!!, I will improve.

## A Side-Note When Reviewing
There were a few images that I was not able to export properly from the design and add to the website. When I tried to export some images, some of the images were being cut and some just didn't have good quality. There were only about 2 images that had these probelems, so if you don't see them on the website, just know these were the reasons.
